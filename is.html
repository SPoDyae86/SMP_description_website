     <p class="text"> To Introduce this server, we have to understand "lore" and its overusage. The Dream SMP was ONE of the first servers to use lore, and since then it's been used more and more. That's because the people within that server not only have many subscribers/followers, meaning that they can easily display their new concepts to millions of people within minutes, but they also knew HOW to perform it (A mix of experience and luck.) Unfortunately, the concept of lore is quite a difficult stunt, and normally takes years to learn how to perform in an enjoyable way. The Muskrat SMP is a fine example of this. the overusage of lore ever since the first season has cut many seasons short, and has enraged most members of the server for a multitude of reasons. Two of the biggest reasons are the addition of untrustworthy and unknown members (to help jumpstart the lore. This has also lead to the theft and grief of properties) and the inability to choose to do something else. The SPoD SMP aims to resolve both problems, and that is why I ask that you join. This will not be a server of survival lore UNLESS it is desired by the majority.
